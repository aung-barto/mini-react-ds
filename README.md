# UI Kit — A Small React Design System

A small, opinionated React UI kit built to demonstrate my approach to **visual design**, **component architecture**, **design-system thinking**, and **interaction design**.

This project is intentionally minimal. It focuses on the foundations that matter most for designing and building modern B2B product interfaces: structure, hierarchy, clarity, and component reusability.

This UI kit is inspired by my experience working with design systems such as IBM’s Carbon Design System, while being built fully from scratch for this project.

Key design goals:

- **Clarity and hierarchy first** — calm neutrals, meaningful spacing, and strong text hierarchy.
- **Product-driven visuals** — designed for real workflows, not marketing pages.
- **Accessible by default** — focus outlines, label + aria support, color contrast.
- **Composable API design** — components are easy to extend and consistent across the kit.
- **Interaction polish** — hover, focus, keyboard navigation, and empty states matter.
